# EigenThings

- This is just a representation of the power of SVD (Singular Value Decompasition)
- SVD basically states that any matrix can be represented into 3 other matrices.
- the 3 matrices are U S (aka sigma) and V^T:
- U and V^T are said to be Orthogonal Matrices, meaning: U^T = U^-1
- S is a diagnonal matrix
